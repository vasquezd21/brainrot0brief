# 🧠 The Weekly Brainrot Brief

A fully automated tech + internet culture digest that scrapes trending content from:

- 🔥 Hacker News  
- 🧵 Reddit  
- 🧪 Toolify (AI/tech tools)  

And then generates snarky, human-like GPT commentary on each one.

## 🛠️ Built With

- Python
- BeautifulSoup
- Requests
- OpenRouter (real-time GPT calls)
- Markdown output
- Vibes™

## 📬 What It Does

Every time it runs:
1. Scrapes top stories and tools from across the web
2. Calls a GPT model to auto-generate short, punchy comments
3. Outputs a full newsletter-style `.md` file
4. (Soon) Will auto-post to Substack / Beehiiv / Twitter

## 💡 Why?

I wanted a fun way to stay current on what’s hot in tech *without doomscrolling*.  
Alsp might as well build something dumb and make it smart.

## 🚀 Future Plans

- Automatic daily publishing
- Embed images + headlines
- Twitter/X thread version
- RSS + Email delivery
- Add meme detection 👀
